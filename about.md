# About

This is a really shifty church headquartered in Alberta. It is headed up by is Unholiness Renderman and his bishop EvilMog.

## What is the church of wifi?

The ChurchOfWifi or CoWF is the third iteration of a church that goes back to the beginning of DEFCON.

 This Church is a real religion. We believe that insecure forms of encryption on wireless protocols is a sin. We also beleive that telnet that is not wrapped in TLS is a sin. We fight against lazy developers.

 We also are compatible with major world religions, members who are of the following faiths: athiests, christians (multiple denominations, including mormons), jewish, flying spaghetti monster, absurdist, jedi, and more.

 ## How do I join
 To join you must be over the age of majority in the state of the majority in the state/province the initiation is performed in. You must be informed of the initiation ritual and obligations of a church member. Once you have given informed consent you will then take part in the ritual and if EvilMog is on the ball possibly be handed a sticker.

 ## Records
 We do not keep records, I don't like keeping PII, you don't like us having PII, we will allow anything capable of understanding what it means to be a member to join.

 ## Rules
 
 The church of wifi runs with very little rules:
 
 * We accept all humans regardless of appearance, mental capability, sexuality, gender identity, race, veteran status, citizenship status, nationality, and or species (yes we love you too furries)
 * Do not use WEP, or unencrypted telnet, or other unsecure protocols
 * The Church of Wifi follows the DEFCON Code of Conduct, we do not tolerate abuse of any kind and will engage a goon, and/or law enforcement as required to ensure the safety of its members and the public
 * The church of wifi will expel members for engaging in abusive behaviour of any kind
